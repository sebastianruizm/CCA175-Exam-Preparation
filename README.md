## Required Skills

### Data Ingest
The skills to transfer data between external systems and your cluster. This includes the following:
* Import data from a MySQL database into HDFS using Sqoop
* Export data to a MySQL database from HDFS using Sqoop
* Change the delimiter and file format of data during import using Sqoop
* Ingest real-time and near-real-time streaming data into HDFS
* Process streaming data as it is loaded onto the cluster
* Load data into and out of HDFS using the Hadoop File System commands

### Transform, Stage, and Store
Convert a set of data values in a given format stored in HDFS into new data values or a new data format and write them into HDFS.
* Load RDD data from HDFS for use in Spark applications
* Write the results from an RDD back into HDFS using Spark
* Read and write files in a variety of file formats
* Perform standard extract, transform, load (ETL) processes on data

### Data Analysis
Use Spark SQL to interact with the metastore programmatically in your applications. Generate reports by using queries against loaded data.
* Use metastore tables as an input source or an output sink for Spark applications
* Understand the fundamentals of querying datasets in Spark
* Filter data using Spark
* Write queries that calculate aggregate statistics
* Join disparate datasets using Spark
* Produce ranked or sorted data

### Configuration
This is a practical exam and the candidate should be familiar with all aspects of generating a result, not just writing code.
* Supply command-line options to change your application configuration, such as increasing available memory
